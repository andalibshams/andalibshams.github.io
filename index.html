        <p>Hello, I am Andalib a Ph.D. student and research assistant in the Department of Civil Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU) under the supervision of Christopher M. Day. Prior to joining ISU, I did my MS in Civil Engineering from University of Wyoming in 2018. I worked there as a graduate assistant and supervised by Milan Zlatkovic . I did my Bachelors in Urban and Regional Planning from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2015.
My current research is in vehicle trajectory based adaptive traffic signal control.
